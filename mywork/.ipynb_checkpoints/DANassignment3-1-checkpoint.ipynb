Go to [this site](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/matrices/SNAP/roadNet-CA.html) and download the data in Matrix Market format (`.mtx`).

For example, the [clustering coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_coefficient), which reveals the proportion of small closed loops in a network, is computed as the number of realized triangles divided by the number of possible triangles.*"
